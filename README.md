After selecting the 'Generate Password' button, you will be presented with a series of prompts. The first prompt, asking for length, must be given an input of an integer number between 8 and 128. Press 'Ok' to submit the prompt, and 'Cancel' to exit the generation. This is the only prompt where you can exit the generation until you are finished.

The next prompts will be asking for what types of character you would like included in your password. Press 'Ok' if you would like that character in your password, or 'Cancel' if you would not like that character in your password.

You MUST select at least one type of character for the password to be generated.
